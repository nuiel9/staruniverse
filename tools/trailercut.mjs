// The cut is data, at the top, so it can be argued with. Everything below it is
// mechanical: pull each in-point out of its take, re-encode all of them to one
// format so the concat demuxer will accept them, join, and lay the title over
// the tail.
//
// The title is rendered by the *game*, not by ffmpeg — this build has no
// drawtext filter, and more to the point the boot overlay is already the right
// type at the right tracking, so screenshotting it with the progress bar and
// the button hidden gives a card that matches the product instead of one that
// approximates it.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- the cut
 *
 * The second version, and both notes on the first one were about pace.
 *
 * **Longer takes.** The first cut averaged a shot and a half a second, which
 * reads as a montage of a rendering rather than as a game being played. This
 * one averages four and a half and nothing is under four: a player's experience
 * of this game is continuous and slow, and a trailer that cuts every forty
 * frames is advertising a different one. Ten shots instead of sixteen, over
 * nearly twice the running time.
 *
 * **No silhouettes.** Every shot that put the star behind the hull came back as
 * a black outline inside a blue halo — the fold tunnel, the star crossing, the
 * arrival flash. They are gone, and the anamorphic streak that drew the halo
 * has been pulled back besides (see PostFX). Every exterior here is lit between
 * fifty-five and ninety degrees of phase, so the hull has a lit face, a
 * terminator and a shadowed side.
 *
 * The order is the shape of a session rather than a highlight reel: the seat
 * you fly from, the ship you live in, the world you are over, the way down, and
 * the ground.
