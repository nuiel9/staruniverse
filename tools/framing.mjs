// How much of the seated frame is actually space?
//
// "The cockpit is so gigantic you can barely see any of space" is a real
// complaint and it is measurable, so it should be measured rather than argued
// about. This sits the player at the helm, renders the frame twice — once with
// the cabin drawn and once with it hidden — and counts the pixels that did not
// change. Those are the pixels the canopy lets through.
//
// It also reports where the sky sits vertically, because a cockpit can pass on
// area while still putting the window in a letterbox slot: a canopy that opens
// upward reads as a windscreen, one that opens as a horizontal band across the
// middle reads as a gunslit.

/* Measure by *hue*, not by difference.

   The obvious method — shoot with the cabin and without it, and count the
   pixels that did not change — is wrong here, and wrong in the direction that
   flatters nothing: hiding the cabin removes most of the light in the frame, so
   auto-exposure opens and the sky changes too. Measured, the frame mean falls
   34.9 to 9.7 and about 45% of the planet's pixels move further than any sane
   difference threshold, so sky gets counted as cabin. Pinning the exposure does
   not fix it either — the uniform that looks like exposure is a multiplier on
   top of the adaptation, not the adaptation itself.

   So: paint the whole world a saturated green and hide everything in it. Green
   appears nowhere in the cabin (the one reserved hue in this game is a pale
   gold-green used only on Hush artefacts, and none are aboard). Anything that
   comes back green-dominant is a pixel the canopy let through. Hue survives any
   exposure the tonemap picks, which is the entire point. */
