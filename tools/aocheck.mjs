/* Is the AO's depth reconstruction actually right?
 *
 * The renderer writes two different depth encodings in one frame — the world
 * and the ground scene use three's logarithmic buffer, the cabin is a second
 * pass on the ordinary projection curve — and PostFX normalises both into one
 * linear view-space Z buffer before the occlusion pass ever runs. A mistake
 * there does not throw and does not look like a mistake: you get occlusion
 * that is plausible in one scene and inverted or missing in another.
 *
 * So it is checked against arithmetic instead of against a screenshot. For a
 * scattering of pixels this fires a raycast at the same pixel, takes the hit
 * point, transforms it into view space, and compares -z against what came back
 * out of the linear-depth target. Anything over a fraction of a percent means
 * the inversion is wrong.

// Each case: set the camera up, then say which object to raycast and with

//
// The point of three cases is that this renderer carries *two* depth encodings
// and the AO pass has to reconstruct linear depth from either. `space` is the
// logarithmic buffer, which the floating origin needs; `cabin` and `ground` are
// both projection depth. The ground used to be logarithmic too and no longer
// is — it spans about 6 m to 26 km, which a 24-bit buffer holds comfortably,
// and log depth writes gl_FragDepth in every fragment, which kills early-Z.
// Keep at least one case on each encoding or this gate stops testing the thing
// it exists to test.
