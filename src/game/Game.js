   Two scenes, two depth policies, and the near plane is what pays for it.

   In space one unit is a kilometre and a frame holds a console switch and a
   gas giant seventy thousand kilometres across, which is why the world is
   drawn with three's logarithmic depth buffer and a near plane of a few metres.
   The ground is not that scene. It spans about six metres to the 26 km horizon
   cut, with the sky dome at REACH * 1.6 = 41.6 km behind it — a range 24 bits
   of ordinary depth hold with room to spare — and log depth costs it dearly,
   because `gl_FragDepth` in every fragment defeats early-Z rejection and every
   Apple GPU is tile-based. Measured at 5.72 Mpx: 29.3 -> 21.2 ms parked, and
   40.3 -> 24.1 ms on foot.

   So the ground pass runs on the ordinary projection curve, and the near plane
   has to be raised to pay for it: depth resolution goes as z^2 / near, so the
   5 cm plane the log buffer allowed leaves 800 m of quantisation at the
   skyline. Half a metre brings that to 80 m — invisible against a smooth
   heightfield with nothing co-located out there — and still gives 7 mm at the
   parked hull and a micron at your boots. The far plane comes in to match:
   6e7 was sized for a solar system. */

   the terrain, the scatter and the sky do not. Keeping most of the level on

     Arrival and departure.

     Both of these used to be one synchronous function that swapped a whole
     scene between two frames, and both measured as a stall: 233 ms on the frame
     after a landing and 554 ms on the frame after a liftoff, at 5.7 Mpx, with
     nothing on screen to explain either. Almost none of it is the terrain —
     constructing a Surface and baking its two per-vertex textures is 33 ms. It
     is *shader compilation*, and specifically `setGroundDepth`: it moves
     forty-odd hull materials between the two logarithmic-depth variants, three
     deletes a program the instant its last material stops using it, and so
     every transition threw one entire variant of the hull away and rebuilt it
     from source. The measured programs bear it out exactly — 42 new
     `physical,STANDARD` programs on the frame after a liftoff.

     So the swap is a sequence now rather than a statement. The camera leaves
     the ship for a few seconds either way, and behind that:

       1. the Surface is constructed on one frame and baked on the next, so the
          two costs land in different frames instead of one;
       2. at the entry flare — the one moment the hull is legitimately not in
          the picture — the hull is re-parented into the scene it is about to
          belong to and both scenes' materials are flipped;
       3. `compileAsync` builds every program the new scene needs. Its
          *synchronous* half measures 32 ms; everything after that is the
          driver's parallel-compile threads, and the frame loop runs straight
          through it at 20 ms a frame because the promise yields;
       4. and only then does the scene actually change over, on a frame where
          the shot it cuts to is already composed.

     The director's shot 2 holds until step 3 finishes, so a slow machine gets a
     slightly longer hold rather than a stutter, and a fast one does not wait.
