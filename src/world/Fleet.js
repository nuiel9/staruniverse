/* ============================================================================
   Traffic.

   A system with nothing moving in it is a diorama. This module is what makes
   one read as inhabited: freighters grinding between worlds, couriers cutting
   across the ecliptic, tugs working a belt, and — occasionally — something that
   was not built by anyone still alive.

   Four things make traffic work at these distances:

   **A ship you cannot resolve still has to be visible.** Sixty metres of hull
   at four million kilometres is far below a pixel. Every craft therefore
   carries *beacons* — camera-facing quads whose world size is set each frame so
   they land at a constant few pixels — plus a drive plume that does the same.
   From across a system a freighter is a moving amber spark; that spark is what
   sells the place as busy, not the hull it is attached to.

   **Silhouette, and a front and a back.** These hulls are seen at forty pixels
   far more often than at four hundred, and at forty pixels nothing survives but
   the outline. So every class is built around one shape you can name — a loaded
   spine, a dart, a cab-and-engine, a cutter, a satellite — with the masses
   separated by empty space and the heavy end aft. A box with greebles on it is
   not a spacecraft at any distance.

   **Models are templates, instances are clones.** Each class is built once and
   welded per material; instances share the geometry and the materials outright,
   so twelve ships cost twelve transforms and no extra memory. All of a craft's
   running lights are one mesh and all of its plumes are another, which keeps
   even the freighter under ten draws.

   **Everything is on a schedule, not a simulation.** Craft follow analytic
   paths keyed to `time`, which means they are exactly where they should be
   after a fold jump, a system reload or a two-minute pause, with no integration
   drift and no wake-up cost.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------- the beacon

   One shared shader for every distance-locked light in the game. The vertex
   stage sizes each quad from its own view depth so it holds a fixed pixel size
   once the real geometry has shrunk below it — which is the only reason a hull
   four million kilometres away is still a moving spark rather than nothing.

   All of a craft's lights live in *one* mesh: the quad centre, colour, gain,
   physical size, pixel size and flash mode are per-vertex, so a freighter's
   eleven lamps cost one draw call and one material instead of eleven of each.
   Only the strobe phase is a uniform, because it is the one thing that has to
   differ between two ships built from the same template.

   BEACON_HDR is the difference between a running light and a grey dot, and it
   is the trap this project has written down and fallen into anyway. These quads
   land in the scene-linear HDR target and go through AgX like everything else,
   and a pixel needs something like 120 units of radiance before AgX returns
   white. The per-lamp gains are 1.2 to 2.6. So every navigation light, strobe
   and docking lamp in the fleet was authored at about two per cent of the
   value it needed, and the measured result is exactly what you would predict:
   a courier framed against a lit planet at the range a player actually sees one
   is a pale lump with a single faint green speck on it. The gains stay as they
   are — they are the *relative* weights, and they are right — and one shared
   multiplier puts the whole set into real HDR, where a nav light sits just
   under the clip point and blooms, and a xenon strobe clips hard, which is what
   a xenon strobe does. Sizing was never the problem: uMinPx already holds every
   lamp at five pixels however far away the hull is. */
